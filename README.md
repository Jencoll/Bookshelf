# Bookshelf app

This is my final project done at the end of the Full-Stack Web Development program at Concordia University. I had two weeks to plan, organize and create the backend and the frontend of an app from scratch.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Create an account and login so they see a custom homepage
- Search for a book using keywords such as ISBN, author name or book title
- Add a book to their personal library, whether manually or using the search bar
- Classify their books based on categories they create
- Edit a book's information
- Add books to a wishlist
- Add tags to their books to extend the classification capabilities
- Interact with other readers/users of the app
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### What I learned

This project was really challenging and interesting for me because I had to plan, organize and create a database, the backend and the frontend of an app within 2 weeks. Each day, I had to determine which were the priorities in order to have a functional app at the end.

This project gave me a good overview of how to efficiently plan the development of an app so that the frontend and the backend "communicate" properly.

I built with mobile-first in mind, and for the next projects, I want to focus more on this part.

### Continued development

I didn't have the time to develop as many features as I wanted. For example, all the users features, and some important ones about the book, were discarded.
Also, the way I structured the components was not always optimal for the appearance. 

For the version 2 of the project, I plan to better organize the database, continue working of all the important features and improve the design of the app.
